MOODSYNC: Your Emotional Compass For Content Exploration 

Description --> It is my Integrated Project on Emotion detection in which content (for now music) is being recommended when emotion is detected and then based on that
                emotion an embedded spotify iframe will pop up with emotion related songs in there...

Problems:
1) here i have to run two files in terminal first "npm start" for frontend and then "python emotion_detection.py" so i wanna solve it and i want the python code to be run when
   the "TRY NOW" button is clicked....
2) emotion detection system is accurate enough but is laggy sometimes...
